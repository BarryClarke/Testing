## 1. Background
### Ronald Fisher 
![Ronald Fisher](/Images/Ronald.Fisher.jpg)  
[Ronald Fisher](http://leansixsigmadefinition.com/glossary/ronald-fisher/)  
* British statistician and geneticist (17th February 1890 - 29th July 1962)
* Widely considered to be "the single most important figure in 20th century statistics" 
* First to propose the Design of Experiments (The Design of Experiments (1935))
* Credited with initiating methods which led to Six Sigma and Lean Manufacturing [Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma](http://leansixsigmadefinition.com/glossary/six-sigma/)
* Responsible for many other statistcal techniques such as [Analysis of Variance](http://leansixsigmadefinition.com/glossary/anova/), [P-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value), and [Linear discriminant analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis)


### Fisher's Iris dataset
* Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper *[The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x)* as an example of Linear discriminant analysis.
* The data set contains 3 species of Iris: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica. For each specie, 50 samples were gathered and, for each sample, the length and the width of the Sepal and the Petal were measured.
* Two of the three species were collected in Gasp√© Peninsula, all from the same pasture, picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus
